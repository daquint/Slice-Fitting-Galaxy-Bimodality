# Slice-Fitting-Galaxy-Bimodality
Fitting and visualization tools used in the Master Thesis: "Characterization of nuclear activity for galaxies in different large-scale environments in terms of morphology, colour, and specific star formation rate" by Daniel Ariza Quintana, for the definition of separation criteria.

# Files 
* SliceFit.py - Python file with the funtions. It contains the fitting tools and visualization.
* ExampleSliceFit.ipynb - Jupyterlab file containing a use example of the fitting tools for the sSFR vs stellar mass diagram.
